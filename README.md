# Friends-and-Colleagues

In this application I demonstrate how to CRUD data in two different databases!

So from the client-side (is created with React) there is a double CRUD operation 

with Graphql through a single Express server, to a Mysql and to Mongo database. 

The "Friends" CRUD goes to MYSQL and the "Colleagues" CRUD to MONGO.
