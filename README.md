# Friends-and-Colleagues

In this application I demonstrate how to CRUD data in two different databases!

So from the client-side (React) there is a double CRUD operation based on Graphql through Express server, to the Mysql and Mongo databases. 

The "Friends" CRUD goes to MYSQL and the "Colleagues" CRUD to MONGO.
